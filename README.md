# FlexCode

Built using [Superflex](https://www.superflex.ai/) for the [Superflex Frontend Hackathon](https://www.nosu.io/hackathons/superflex).

## Overview

This project is a web-based AI code editorâ€”complete with file tree, source code editor, and AI-powered coding assistant. Users can interact with the assistant to receive advice or analysis about their code. The application leverages OpenAI's language model to analyze user input and provide relevant code completions and explanations.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Users can ask questions about their code and receive detailed responses from the AI assistant.
- **File Management**: Users can open and save files directly from the application, making it easy to manage their coding projects.
- **Dynamic Language Detection**: The application automatically detects the programming language based on the file extension.

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Use the chat interface to ask questions or get code suggestions.

4. Open files to edit and save your code directly from the application.
